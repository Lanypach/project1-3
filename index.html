<p>I am a returning college student hoping to graduate with an A.S. Degree in Cybersecurity at Cerritos College. I have had a lot of confusion in determining what I want to pursue education wise, and I feel as though I have finally found interest in tech. I cannot wait to learn more about the tech industry and create my own portfolio of projects. My interest in Cybersecurity stemmed from my experience working for a financial institution, mainly in a call center environment where part of my responsibilities included assisting customers with their online accounts being hacked and numerous fraudulent incidents. I've experienced a large amount people being taken advantage of over the years and have come to the conclusion that there is definitely opportunity for Cybersecurity protection to be implemented to prevent such incidents. I am hoping to be able to one day create better structure for the protection of individual's personal information. </p>
